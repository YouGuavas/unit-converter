# Unit Converter

This is a unit converter app built with React, Nextjs, sass, and typescript. I am using this as an opportunity to learn the basics of typescript, while building an app that will prove useful to me going forward.

## Getting Started

First, clone and move into the repository:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YouGuavas/unit-converter.git
    cd unit-converter
```

Then, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
